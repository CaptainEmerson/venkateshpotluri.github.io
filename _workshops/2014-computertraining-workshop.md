This was a 7 day workshop organized in collaboration with Frontline Eye Hospital, Chennai. The goal was to train participants with the use of assistive technology to perform basic tasks like word processing, basic accounting, email, recreation, etc.

The unique component of this workshop was the introduction to online file storage services like google drive and dropbox and an emphasis on collaborating on documents using google docs with accessibility in mind. I was the resource person for this workshop and was also responsible for designing content and practice exercises and teaching them to the participants.

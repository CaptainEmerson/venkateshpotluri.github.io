Organized a one day workshop in collaboration with Frontline Eye Hospital, Chennai on assistive technology. This was an introductory workshop focused on spreading awareness and demonstrating the possibilities assistive technology opens up. The target audience were parents with children with visual impairments, rehabilitation trainers, and persons with visual impairments. I was one of the 2 resource persons for the workshop and was responsible for designing content, demos and presenting them to the participants.

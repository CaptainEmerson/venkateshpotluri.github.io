Information access with a screen reader is very linear and is very dependent on the cursor focus. Vision, as an input channel, on the other hand enables a person to receive and process information paralelly and at a glance. Moreover, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are designed to indecate important secondary information through tooltips, code coloring, etc. This secondary information is often not conveyed to a screen reader user intuitively. With Soundscape for VisualStudio, we are exploring the use of a Spatial Audio UI to convey this secondary information and much more to a screen reader user in a novel yet unique way.

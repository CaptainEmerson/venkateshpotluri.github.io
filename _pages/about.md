I am an aspiring researcher in Computer Science, a composer and drummer. I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and am advised by [Dr. Manohar Swaminathan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/swmanohmicrosoft-com/). Broadly, my research interests are in the areas of HCI and Accessibility. My current focus is on improving developer productivity for visually impaired developers in GUI based programming environments. I am a B.Tech HONS and MS by Research (dual degree) graduate from [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) and was advised by [Dr. Kishore S Prahallad](https://sites.google.com/site/kishoreprahallad/) and [Dr. Priyanka Srivastava](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~priyanka.srivastava/) on my thesis on Audio Rendering of Mathematical Content. There is lots to know about me here. When we meet (in person or over a skype call), lets brainstorm on the next big opportunity to improve accessibility and make the world a more inclusive place.

##Why accessibility?

Due to my vision impairment, I adapted various methods for learning and independent daily living. In this process, I have come across different variety of assistive technology.

I realised that a lot of these were lacking in functionality and there was a wide scope and need for improvement. I want to contribute in developing assistive technology by looking at a problem from both the user as well as a developer’s perspective.

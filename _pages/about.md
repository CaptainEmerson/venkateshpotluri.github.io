I am an aspiring researcher in Computer Science, a composer, drummer and a person who would do what it takes to enjoy every moment. I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and am advised by [Dr. Manohar Swaminathan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/swmanohmicrosoft-com/). Broadly, my research interests are in the areas of HCI and Accessibility. My current focus is on improving developer productivity for visually impaired developers in GUI based programming environments. I am a B.Tech HONS and MS by research (dual degree) graduate from [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) and was advised by [Dr. Kishore S Prahallad](https://sites.google.com/site/kishoreprahallad/) and [Dr. Priyanka Srivastava](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~priyanka.srivastava/) on my thesis on Audio Rendering of Mathematical Content. There is lots to know about me here. When we ever meet, lets brainstorm on the next big opportunity to improve accessibility and make the world a more inclusive place.
